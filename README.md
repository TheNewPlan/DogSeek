# DogSeek
An Android Application to help people find a breed that fits their lifestyle

The goal of this application for it's prototype stage is to having a working filter system that allows a user to enter in some of values and return a new ListView
From this listview there will be some basic information displayed.

In addition, I will implement a multitouch command to open directly to the AKC webpage with information about the breed.

Longterm goal, externalize the requests from the local app in order to help save space and further streamline the applicaition.
